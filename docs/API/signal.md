## signal
> Generate signals

This is a collection of functions to generate signals using one sample a time.
This is a quite slow implementation and not ready for realtime generation.
The main focus is on easy to read, aka learn-dsp.

This implementation is largely based on the excellent [genish.sh](https://github.com/charlieroberts/genish.js)
library that has much more performance than this one.
