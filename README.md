# dsp-kit

> A digital signal processing library in Javascript

Since I usually learn by coding, this is the result of my learning on dsp.

This is largely based in the now abandoned [dsp.js](https://github.com/corbanbrook/dsp.js) code. Work in progress. Experimental API. Use at your own risk.

This is a [multimodule](https://github.com/oramics/dsp-kit/tree/master/packages) repository.

```js
const dsp = require('dsp-kit')
const signal = dsp.generate(1024, (x) => Math.sin(x))
const fft = new dsp.FFT(1024)
const spectrum = dsp.spectrum(fft.forward(signal))
spectrum.magnitudes // => the magnitude spectrum of the signal
spectrum.phases // => the phase spectrum of the signal
```

## Documentation

Read the [generated API documentation](https://github.com/oramics/dsp-kit/blob/master/docs/README.md)

## Development

Clone the repo and install dependencies: `npm install` and init lerna: `lerna bootstrap`

- __run tests__: `npm test`
- __run benchmarks__: `npm run benchmarks`
- __generate documentation__: `npm run docs`
