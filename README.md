# dsp-kit

> A digital signal processing library in Javascript

Since I usually learn by coding, this is the result of my learning on dsp.

Work in progress. Experimental API. Use at your own risk.

This is a [multimodule](https://github.com/oramics/dsp-kit/tree/master/packages) repository.

```js
const dsp = require('dsp-kit')
const signal = dsp.buffer.generate(1024, (x) => Math.sin(x))
const spectrum = dsp.spectrum(dsp.fft.forward(signal))
```
